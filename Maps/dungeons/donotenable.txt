Don't enable these files, they're dungeon files that are randomly picked for RNG dungeons.

HOW 2 DUNGEON:
Needed Knowledge: The Maps/dungeons folder is where all maps will be saved and loaded from. When done with creating a map, take it from this directory and place it into the equivilant server directory. (../Maps/Dungeons/)
You need a copy of the source files to compile and create your map.
Step 1: Open Dream Maker
Step 2: Pre-emptively compile the game. (If there is errors, get a earlier version or wait for another version. Most versions won't have this issue.)
Step 3: Create a new map file that is 125x125
Try to make the map the last alphabetically. Sometimes there may be a empty template already there. (zzz_map_template.dmm)
Step 4: Using editor objects and tiles, create the map. Take note of the spawnpoint you want, and place two dungeon exits somewhere. Instanced items are saved, and do work.
Step 5: Create a .txt file with the same name as the dungeon file name, and copy the parameters below.
Step 6: Edit appropriately. After you're satisfied, copy both files to server directory, and upon dungeon rotation, it will automatically be included in the list.
Step 7: You can create a dungeon manually via Admin commands. Knowing the specific name of the dungeon is important in this case.



Dungeon Templates: Each are 125 x 125, and four can be initialized at once. Leave one entrance, one exit. Dungeons do not persist through reboots.
Leave a wall around the entire dungeon. If there is no entrance defined in the code's dungeon list, you will not be able to enter the dungeon.
